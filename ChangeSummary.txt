I find HTML to be really useful in dividing information up and making it easy to read. 
Its structure provides clear organization, which enhances the overall user experience. 
I have taken a couple HTML classes in the past and a lot of the basics we learned in class I have learned a couple times already, so these topics aren't that new to me. 
However, it is always good to revisit concepts, as it reinforces the fundamentals and allows for new perspectives on how to apply them. 
For this formatting project, I focused on the hierarchy of information in my essay and properly assigned headings to those individual sections. 
This step is crucial in making content more accessible and organized for readers. 
I did this by adding <h#> tags to the different headings to help separate those sections. 
This is especially important because it helps define the hierarchy of information throughout the site and makes it easier to read through. 
Clear headings guide the reader and allow them to navigate content more effectively.

In addition to the headings, I also added some bold and italics on the important parts of my text to emphasize them. 
Emphasizing key points is essential in guiding the reader’s attention to important information. 
I did this by using the <i>, <em>, and <b> to change the text decoration of these sentences. 
I know that <em> and <i> do essentially the same thing, but I wanted to use them both to prove I know their uses and to show the different contexts in which they are applied. 
In some cases, <em> may be used for emphasis, while <i> is often for styling or introducing foreign words. 
I also incorporated a couple of unordered lists in my site. Since the items in the list aren't step-by-step instructions or something similar, I opted to use unordered lists. 
Lists can break up content and make it more digestible, providing a clear visual structure to support readers as they scan through the text. 
These formatting strategies ensure that the content is not only visually appealing but also functional for the reader.
